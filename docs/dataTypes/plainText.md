# Plain text

## Description

Text is a broad category of data.
For some, text is something that you type with Microsoft Word,
for others it is what they read in a PDF, and for yet others it is the
program code they hack in a text editor.

For the purposes of archiving we divide the text data type in 
[formatted text](formattedText.md) and **plain text**.md).

Plain text consists of text strings without any particular layout information
other than that which can be achieved by spaces, tabs and newlines.

Plain text is mostly used for IT purposes:

*   writing software code (programs), using a *text editor* or
    an *IDE* (integrated developing environment)
*   writing quick notes, using a simple program like *notepad*
*   for data with formal characteristics, such as 
    [JSON](../fileTypes/json.md)
    [CSV](../fileTypes/csv.md)
    [XML](../fileTypes/xml.md)
    [SQL](../fileTypes/sql.md)
