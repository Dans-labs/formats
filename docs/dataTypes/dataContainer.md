## Description

Structured data needs a concept of *container* to hold the structure
by which various items of data are kept together.

Think of parts and wholes, files and directories, text and markup.

Data containers are a generic concept. They can be used for a variety
of purposes, which may overlap with other data types, such as [Text (formatted)](../dataTypes/textFormatted.md)
and [Database](../dataTypes/database.md).

Often, data containers are just plain text files that adhere to a defined
scheme that gives structure to their contents.
