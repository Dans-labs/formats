# Database

## Description

Databases exist in various forms, the best known probably being the
*relational database*.
Databases are managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). Besides
ensuring consistency of data and their processing (reading and writing), the
DBMS controls roles and privileges of users (groups) and also offers a range of
functions to perform various operations on the data. The file format is usually
linked to the DBMS, but there are independent exchange formats too.

## Representations

There are several database representation methods, such as

*   [SQL](../fileTypes/sql.md):
    a long standing, ubiquitous way of handling relational databases
*   [SIARD](../fileTypes/siard.md):
    a modern attempt to represent relational data in a
    software-indpependent way
*   [CSV-files](../fileTypes/csv.md):
    plain text files with rows and columns
*   Legacy formats
    that may better be converted to more sustainable formats:
    *   [dBase](../fileTypes/dbase.md)
    *   [HDF5](../fileTypes/hdf5.md)
    *   [Microsoft Access](../fileTypes/access.md)
