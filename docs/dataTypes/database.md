## Description

Databases exist in various forms, the best known probably being the
*relational database*.
Databases are managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). Besides
ensuring consistency of data and their processing (reading and writing), the
DBMS controls roles and privileges of users (groups) and also offers a range of
functions to perform various operations on the data. The file format is usually
linked to the DBMS, but there are independent exchange formats too.
