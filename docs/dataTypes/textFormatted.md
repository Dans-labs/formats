## Description

Text is a broad category of data.
For some, text is something that you type with Microsoft Word,
for others it is what they read in a PDF, and for yet others it is the
program code they hack in a text editor.

For the purposes of archiving we divide the text data type in 
[Text (formatted)](../dataTypes/textFormatted.md) and [Text (plain)](../dataTypes/textPlain.md).

Formatted text consists of text strings with layout information.
A formatted text does not only display the bare text material, but it formats
the texts by arranging it in pages and columns, by applying fonts in different
colors, sizes, weights and shapes, and combining it with various graphical
objects such as images.

Formatted text can get very complex.
