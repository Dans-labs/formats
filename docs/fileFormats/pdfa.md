## Description

[Portable Document Format (PDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF),
has been developed by software maker Adobe to represent printed documents
faithfully and consistently independent of the computer and platform 
where it is displayed.

It has a subtype called
[PDF/A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A)
which is specifically designed for long-term sustainability.
PDF/A is the international standard for (formatted) text
documents. A PDF/A file is a stand-alone document: all fonts and images are
included in the file, so it is not dependent on other files on the computer to
correctly display its content.
No part of the contents of a PDF/A file is encrypted.

There are several types of PDF/A. PDF/A-1a is recommended for text documents
that were created entirely on a computer (“born digital”). For digitized
documents PDF/A-1b is a suitable format.

PDF viewers are pretty much part of the operating system nowadays, but if not,
the Adobe Reader can be downloaded for free.
Facilities to create PDF are near universal, because either the operating system
or many applications let you "print" files as PDF.
For example, Microsoft Word. Excel, and Powerpoint let you export documents
as PDF, and so do the open source office suites such as Libre Office and the 
Mac programs Pages, Numbers and KeyNote.

An other free application that can “print” documents to a PDF is
Bullzip PDF Printer.

Modifying PDF files is less well supported by free programs, although
marking up PDFs with annotations is getting mainstream.

It is also possible to generate PDF as output from programs, there are
good libraries to create custom PDFs.

Users of (La)TeX have especially sophisticated tools to create virtually any
PDF they want.

PDF can be used to represent images. Conversions between more common image
formats and PDF can be performed with programs such as IrfanView and
ImageMagick.

Of course, Adobe sells quite capable software for creating PDF files.
