### Recommendation

*dBase* formats can be read in
several different database applications, including LibreOffice/OpenOffice, MySQL
and MS Access.
From these applications, it is possible to export the dBase data
into other formats, such as
[SQL](sql.md) or [CSV](csv.md).

## Description

The
[dBase Table File Format (.dbf)]({{wikipedia}}/.dbf)
is a proprietary product. The company behind
dBase will still support older versions of the format. For versions earlier than
7 no official documentation is made available.
