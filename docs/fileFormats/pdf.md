# PDF

**Portable Document Format**

???+ abstract "In short"
    Declarative specification of printed pages, developed by Adobe after [PostScript](../fileFormats/postscript.md), now standardized. Deals with the most complex material that is printable, takes care of font and other graphics inclusions, makes text searchable. See also [PDF/A](../fileFormats/pdfa.md). PDF looks perfect from the outside, it may look horrible from the inside.
