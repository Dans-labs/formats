## Description

[TAR]({{wikipedia}}/Tar_(computing) is a container format,
historically used to create tape archives from large directories,
in order to remove it from the computer and store it away.

It is a transparent way to represent a directory and all of it contents,
including subdirectories and their contents, in a single file.

By itself, it does not use compression nor encryption, although in practice its
use is nearly always combined with (g)zip in order to economize on storage.
