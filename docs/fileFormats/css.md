## Description

[CSS]({{wikipedia}}/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
is a style sheet language for styling
[HTML](../fileFormats/html.md) documents.

HTML files may contain CSS styles inside, or they may refer to other files for
their styling.

## Complications

The World-wide-web is one of the most dynamic corners of IT. Standards are
always on the move, and new patterns of organizing web content replace the best
practices of yesterday.

CSS is gone through several major versions.

The format is plain text, so CSS files are easy to open,
but the meaning of the styles is dependent on the version of the
CSS styling engine that has been used.

Moreover, in real-world web applications, CSS files are often
deliberately `uglified`, in order to decrease their file size.
