SGML, HTML, XML, and XHTML \u00b6 XML, HTML and SGML are common and suitable markup language formats, provided the file formats are valid and complete (see paragraph below). Apart from these formats there are XML-based or SGML-based formats that can only be read by special software. Such files cannot be accepted without further verification; please check with DANS. Connections between SG/X/HT/XHT-ML SGML is a classic, which has been extensively used to manufacture large bodies of documentation. Slightly newer is HTML , which is the defining characteristic of the world wide web. XML arose as an attempt to make SGML simpler and to subsume HTML in the process. Technically, XML is an application profile of the ISO standard SGML : all XML files are SGML files. Since XML has a much stricter syntax, it is easier to validate. Since then, XML has evolved further, there are various definition schemes and ways of validating XML , and it contains elements that are not defined in SGML in the same way, such as the encoding attribute. All text in an XML document is by definition in Unicode . HTML is another variant of SGML; it is primarily intended for the presentation of rich text (and layout) and hyperlinks to other documents. In addition to \u201cregular\u201d HTML there is also XHTML , which is HTML under the stricter rules of XML . SGML and XML are hardly being further developed. Quirks in the history of HTML The story of HTML is more intriguing. Whereas the W3C has tried, for a long time , to integrate HTML with XML , the browser vendors, united in the WhatWG consider HTML itself as the technique to develop further and have defined HTML as a Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org). The ways have not really parted, because W3C and WhatWG have signed a memorandum of understanding . Markdown, YAML and JSON \u00b6 These three formats have become very popular in a wide range of contexts. They are not as strictly defined as XML and HTML . Markdown especially has many alternative syntaxes, extensions, and variations. Markdown essentially translates to HTML , and most Markdown processor allow interspersed HTML . That being said, markdown processors also tend to strip such HTML if it is considered dangerous. Raison d'\u00eatre The richness of XML and HTML comes at a price: they are unsuitable for being typed by a human. In scenarios where people have to write extensive documentation and configuration, new light-weight conventions have evolved for for typing formatted text using minimal markup overhead. The visual layout inside a plain text file, by means of white space and newlines, plus a few ASCII patterns with a special meaning serve as markup. Out of this comes Markdown as a format for writing rich text, and YAML has a format for writing nested structures. JSON is a strict format from the Javascript world. It is a way to serialize structrured data, very much like YAML , but with a syntax that is very close to JavaScript. JSON has largely taken over a particular role of XML : exchanging data between computers over a network. Tex and LaTeX \u00b6 Both are used extensively in science and scholarship for writing and publishing papers, mostly in the exact sciences where mathematical formulas are prominent but also in the huimanities where non alphabetic symbols are being used, e.g. music and exotic languages. Many documentation tools use TeX as an intermediate format from which they generate PDF . History One of the first uses of markup for professional type-setting is the classic TeX . Here text is interspersed with macros and commands, most of which start with a backslash. Whereas TeX provides an extremely powerful base for doing typographical computations, LaTeX has been developed as a system to limit the power of raw TeX to more friendly and higher level commands. Recommendations \u00b6 With markup there are two issues that matter greatly for long-term preservation: has the markup been applied in a valid way? is the marked up file complete , i.e. self-contained? Validity \u00b6 Validity of a marked up file means that it can be parsed, which is almost always the first step one has to take in order to make use of such a file. For TeX the criterion is: can the TeX processor handle the file. Unfortunately, there is no rigorous way to test that other than ... running TeX . For JSON , Markdown , YAML , HTML , and XHTML the notion of validity is simple: either the file parses, or it does not. For SGML and XML the notion of validity has been divided into well-formedness and validity . Well-formed and valid Well-formed documents have a correct mixture of markup and text, i.e. the markup elements are properly shaped, start tags and end tags match, all characters are defined. It is a largely cosmetic, but essential requirement. Valid markup language documents are well-formed and moreover comply with an extra set of rules about how the marked up elements hang together. Through schemas, entirely new \u201cfile formats\u201d can be defined, such as format description SVG vector graphics Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format and annotate text MathML mathematical formulas SMIL synchronized multimedia The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) manages the specifications for HTML and XML , and provides a Markup Validator that can validate both XHTML and HTML and additional XML-based formats. These rules that govern the content of a markup document can be described with the help of various substandards, such as a DTD , a W3C schema , or a Relax NG schema . At the top of XML and XHTML documents is a declaration that may refer to such a schema. Whether a file can be validated or not, depends on the presence of such a schema. And that is, in itself, a matter of completeness. Completeness \u00b6 Markup may be based on the use of multiple files in additional file formats. For JSON and YAML this does not play a role. For TeX this is about style file and package files. By studying the log file of a TeX run one can see which files are needed for that run. For SGML , XML , and XHTML it is a matter of style sheets (e.g. CSS , XSLT ), scripts (e.g. JavaScript ), fonts (e.g. WOFF ), and graphics (e.g. PNG ) and the schemas by which the validity is checked. Schemas Last, but not least, the presence of a schema is a matter of completeness.

Connections between SG/X/HT/XHT-ML SGML is a classic, which has been extensively used to manufacture large bodies of documentation. Slightly newer is HTML , which is the defining characteristic of the world wide web. XML arose as an attempt to make SGML simpler and to subsume HTML in the process. Technically, XML is an application profile of the ISO standard SGML : all XML files are SGML files. Since XML has a much stricter syntax, it is easier to validate. Since then, XML has evolved further, there are various definition schemes and ways of validating XML , and it contains elements that are not defined in SGML in the same way, such as the encoding attribute. All text in an XML document is by definition in Unicode . HTML is another variant of SGML; it is primarily intended for the presentation of rich text (and layout) and hyperlinks to other documents. In addition to \u201cregular\u201d HTML there is also XHTML , which is HTML under the stricter rules of XML . SGML and XML are hardly being further developed. Quirks in the history of HTML The story of HTML is more intriguing. Whereas the W3C has tried, for a long time , to integrate HTML with XML , the browser vendors, united in the WhatWG consider HTML itself as the technique to develop further and have defined HTML as a Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org). The ways have not really parted, because W3C and WhatWG have signed a memorandum of understanding .","title":"SGML, HTML, XML, and XHTML"},{"location":"dataTypes/markup/#markdown-yaml-and-json","text":"These three formats have become very popular in a wide range of contexts. They are not as strictly defined as XML and HTML . Markdown especially has many alternative syntaxes, extensions, and variations. Markdown essentially translates to HTML , and most Markdown processor allow interspersed HTML . That being said, markdown processors also tend to strip such HTML if it is considered dangerous. Raison d'\u00eatre The richness of XML and HTML comes at a price: they are unsuitable for being typed by a human. In scenarios where people have to write extensive documentation and configuration, new light-weight conventions have evolved for for typing formatted text using minimal markup overhead. The visual layout inside a plain text file, by means of white space and newlines, plus a few ASCII patterns with a special meaning serve as markup. Out of this comes Markdown as a format for writing rich text, and YAML has a format for writing nested structures. JSON is a strict format from the Javascript world. It is a way to serialize structrured data, very much like YAML , but with a syntax that is very close to JavaScript. JSON has largely taken over a particular role of XML : exchanging data between computers over a network.","title":"Markdown, YAML and JSON"},{"location":"dataTypes/markup/#tex-and-latex","text":"Both are used extensively in science and scholarship for writing and publishing papers, mostly in the exact sciences where mathematical formulas are prominent but also in the huimanities where non alphabetic symbols are being used, e.g. music and exotic languages. Many documentation tools use TeX as an intermediate format from which they generate PDF . History One of the first uses of markup for professional type-setting is the classic TeX . Here text is interspersed with macros and commands, most of which start with a backslash. Whereas TeX provides an extremely powerful base for doing typographical computations, LaTeX has been developed as a system to limit the power of raw TeX to more friendly and higher level commands.","title":"Tex and LaTeX"},{"location":"dataTypes/markup/#recommendations","text":"With markup there are two issues that matter greatly for long-term preservation: has the markup been applied in a valid way? is the marked up file complete , i.e. self-contained?","title":"Recommendations"},{"location":"dataTypes/markup/#validity","text":"Validity of a marked up file means that it can be parsed, which is almost always the first step one has to take in order to make use of such a file.

Text files versus binary files There are several notions of what a character is and what a line break is. A Windows line break is different from a Unix/Linux/Mac line break, and line breaks on OS9 Macs are yet different. Character encoding What a character is, is determined by an encoding , which is a system to map characters to sequences of bits. The most ubiquitous character encoding is ASCII . It encodes a set of 128 characters. This is a basic set consisting of letters, uppercase and lowercase, digits, punctuation, arithmetical symbols, a few currency symbols, space, tab, newline, carriage return, and a few others. Later came the extensions for letters with accents, for other scripts such as Cyrillic and Greek. The first was IBM's CP437 These extension sets were defined by code pages , each of which defined a limited supply of non-ascii characters. Windows had its own notion of code page: 125x . All this was common before UNICODE. Text files from this era pose the difficulty that nothing in the file itself declares which code page is being used. It is a matter of trial and error to determine the right code page, and sometimes it is impossible. This problem is carried over to older text-based formats such as CSV and SQL . While the structure of SQL and CSV files is usually well-defined, the use of undeclared code pages remains a liability. Unicode When Unicode arrived, it had the promise to tidy up most character issues. The Unicode standard is a major achievement. It not only maps nearly every written glyph unto a unique number, it also defines the notions of upper case and lower case intelligently, and it defines types of characters, such as letters, numerals, punctuation, and much more. Last but not least, associated with Unicode are severel encodings to map the unique numbers to streams of bits in efficient ways. In today's world, UTF8 is very common, and especially suited to Western languages, because it coincides with ASCII for the ASCII characters. Other encodings are UTF16 and UTF32 . Specifying a Unicode encoding File formats such as XML make it clear which Unicode encoding is being used. But in general, file types for plain text do not specify the encoding in a standard way. The recommendation is to let a non-UTF8 file start with a special character, the Byte Order Mark (BOM) , from which most applications can deduce the encoding that is being used.","title":"Text (plain)"},{"location":"dataTypes/textPlain/#text-plain","text":"Readable text without special formatting codes In short Text content that is readable without special software. item info formats CSS , CSV , HTML , JSON , Markdown , SQL , TeX , Text , XML , YAML extensions cfg , css , csv , htm , html , ini , json , log , lst , md , sql , sty , tex , text , tsv , txt , xml , yaml related types Markup , Program code , Text (formatted)","title":"Text (plain)"},{"location":"dataTypes/textPlain/#description","text":"Text is a broad category of data.

the \"Portable Document Format\" developed by software giant Adobe, has the PDF/A subtype designed for long-term sustainability. PDF/A is internationally held as the standard for (formatted) text documents. A PDF/A is a stand-alone document: all fonts and images are included in the file, so that it does not depend on other files on the computer to display the content correctly. PDF/A has a number of subtypes. The PDF/A-1a subtype sets further requirements for the text within the document and is recommended for text documents made entirely with the computer (born-digital). The PDF/A-1b subtype is more suitable for digitized documents. Many computers will already have software installed with which PDF files can be opened, if not the Adobe Reader can be downloaded for free. Adobe software for creating PDF files is not free, but various free software packages such as OpenOffice and IrfanView also offer PDF support. There are also print programs with which documents can be \"printed\" to a PDF document, for example the free Bullzip PDF printer. When text documents are created or converted from non-preferred formats such as Microsoft Word, PDF/A is the preferred format for long-term durability and accessibility. However, a conversion from regular PDF to PDF/A is undesirable. If an original text document is a regular PDF, a conversion to PDF/A will offer little added value. In addition, such a conversion even offers the possibility of data loss. That is why original PDF documents that are not PDF/A are also accepted by DANS and included as such in the archive. However, DANS cannot guarantee the accessibility and durability of regular PDF documents.

A PDF/A is a stand-alone document: all fonts and images are included in the file, so that it does not depend on other files on the computer to display the content correctly. PDF/A has a number of subtypes. The PDF/A-1a subtype sets further requirements for the text within the document and is recommended for text documents made entirely with the computer (born-digital). The PDF/A-1b subtype is more suitable for digitized documents. Many computers will already have software installed with which PDF files can be opened, if not the Adobe Reader can be downloaded for free. Adobe software for creating PDF files is not free, but various free software packages such as OpenOffice and IrfanView also offer PDF support. There are also print programs with which documents can be \"printed\" to a PDF document, for example the free Bullzip PDF printer. When text documents are created or converted from non-preferred formats such as Microsoft Word, PDF/A is the preferred format for long-term durability and accessibility. However, a conversion from regular PDF to PDF/A is undesirable. If an original text document is a regular PDF, a conversion to PDF/A will offer little added value. In addition, such a conversion even offers the possibility of data loss. That is why original PDF documents that are not PDF/A are also accepted by DANS and included as such in the archive. However, DANS cannot guarantee the accessibility and durability of regular PDF documents.","title":"Description"},{"location":"extensions/pdf/#remarks","text":"The extension of PDF files, whether they

This format does not support data types and metadata beyond column titles. It is in fact based on the RFC4180 open standard, although there are different variants (dialects). In a CSV file the values/cells from a table are separated by commas, semicolons, or tabs. CSV files can be imported into database applications, but they can also clearly and quickly be opened as a spreadsheet, for example in Microsoft Excel. These files can also be read as Text files, for instance in Notepad. Many applications will be able to open CSV files without problems. Separator character \u00b6 The file extension derives from the original separator character, the c omma. However, other characters such as the semicolon are also frequently used, especially in regions where they are the default separator character. Complications with the comma A region-independent choice of separator character is the tab , and CSV files that use it are often given the extension .tsv . Depending on the computer\u2019s default settings for the use of separators, an application may not be able to automatically separate the columns. However, within the application it is usually possible to divide text into columns on the basis of separation characters chosen by the user; alternatively, the default on the computer can be adjusted. For Windows systems, this default setting can be found under List separator on the Region and Language screen. If the same separator is selected as what is found in the CSV file, that CSV file will be correctly displayed in distinct columns in all applications. Character encoding. \u00b6 There is no standard to declare the character encoding that is used in a CSV file. If the CSV file is in Unicode, there are still many options for the encoding, such as utf8 , utf16 (big endian) , utf16 (least endian) . Details These encodings can be indicated by an optional first character in a file, the so-called Byte Order Mark (BOM) . If the encoding is utf8 , the BOM is usually left out. A CSV file with non-latin characters is best encoded as utf16 least endian with BOM mark. It seems to be the only option if one wants Excel to open the file without trouble. See also Text (plain) .

It is basically a document markup language, in which you can store text plus formatting plus layout. In earlier times, the layout and format options were basic, nowadays both are as sophisticated as the printed page can be. In order to achieve the richest formatting, HTML works together with another standard for styles : CSS . What sets HTML apart from printed work is dynamics: users can interact with a web page, and defining this interaction is delegated to yet another technology, JavaScript , which is a programming language. The ultimate reference to all these technologies is the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) : HTML CSS Javascript HTML files may contain CSS styles inside, or they may refer to other files for their styling. Likewise, they may contain JavaScript inside, or they may refer to other files for their scripting. Complications \u00b6 The World-wide-web is one of the most dynamic corners of IT. Standards are always on the move, and new patterns of organizing web content replace the best practices of yesterday. HTML files may contain complete programs, documentation, and installation procedures on the one hand, or they may consist of long stretches of text with horribly redundant layout codes. Most HTML in the world has not been typed by humans, but has been generated by software. HTML files can be almost one liners that call a big Javascript program that does all the rest, or it may contain everything inside. HTML in the archive \u00b6 One scenario by which HTML files may enter the archive, is when a website gets archived. In that case, it is not the individual HTML files themselves that should be judged for their long-term preservability, but rather the website as an integral system. In this scenario, it is preferable to archive the source code of the web site as well, not only the end result. Nowadays, there are many popular ways to write HTML documentation as generated static pages. The source code resides in a software repository, and the generated pages are served by a service such as readthedocs or GitHub pages . Another scenario is when HTML files with substantial content have been captured from a legacy system, or from other sources.

It is basically a document markup language, in which you can store text plus formatting plus layout. In earlier times, the layout and format options were basic, nowadays both are as sophisticated as the printed page can be. In order to achieve the richest formatting, HTML works together with another standard for styles : CSS . What sets HTML apart from printed work is dynamics: users can interact with a web page, and defining this interaction is delegated to yet another technology, JavaScript , which is a programming language. The ultimate reference to all these technologies is the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) : HTML CSS Javascript HTML files may contain CSS styles inside, or they may refer to other files for their styling. Likewise, they may contain JavaScript inside, or they may refer to other files for their scripting.","title":"Description"},{"location":"fileFormats/html/#complications","text":"The World-wide-web is one of the most dynamic corners of IT. Standards are always on the move, and new patterns of organizing web content replace the best practices of yesterday.

In that case, it is not the individual HTML files themselves that should be judged for their long-term preservability, but rather the website as an integral system. In this scenario, it is preferable to archive the source code of the web site as well, not only the end result. Nowadays, there are many popular ways to write HTML documentation as generated static pages. The source code resides in a software repository, and the generated pages are served by a service such as readthedocs or GitHub pages . Another scenario is when HTML files with substantial content have been captured from a legacy system, or from other sources.

History It used to be a rather ugly and slow scripting language, snippets of which were included in HTML pages to add interaction to elements on the page and to submit forms. In those times it had competitors such as VBScript and PerlScript. When Google introduced the Chrome browser it included a Javascript engine that had a performance that was unheard of. Nowadays JavaScript is a capable, performant, and neat language that runs inside the browser as well outside it, through Node . Since 2015 JavaScript is undergoing extensive development in a backwards compatible way. In that year, ECMA Script 6, or more fondly, ES6 was standardized. Now, in 2019, nearly all of ES6 is nearly fully implemented in nearly all major browsers on nearly all platforms and form factors. See the details . Despite the lack of implementation during the years 2015-2019, many websites have been developed with ES6, using Babel , a transpiler that converts ES6 into pre-2015 Javascript. By the same approach, newer, post-ES6 features can be used in applications. Modern uses Modern websites have taken a lot of advantage from modern JavaScript. There has been a tendency to move processing on the server to the client, which has lead to so-called Single Page Applications (SPA) , where the whole website is generated dynamically inside the browser. This poses new challenges for the archiving of websites in general. For SPAs to work correctly and optimally, web-frameworks such as React and Angular and Vue are needed that supply basic functions in the information flow. These package require subpackages, and they in turn require subpackages, and the app has a whole needs a build framework such as WebPack to bundle everything together, often for a development scenario as well as a production scenario. A moderate SPA requires easily hundreds of packages. It is nearly a miracle that is works, and even a greater miracle that these SPAs tend to work in most browsers. Like CSS , the JavaScript in an SPA tends to be uglified , i.e. compressed by removing all unnecessary whitespace and line-breaks and replacing all names by meaningless short names. Recommendations \u00b6 In order to archive a website that has been built as an SPA, one needs to archive the full build environment in its original organization.

SIARD (Software Independent Archiving of Relational Databases) is intended for archiving relational databases in a way that is as independent of the original DBMS as possible. This format takes into account all the significant characteristics of databases. SIARD is an open, freely available format, based on clear text formats: Unicode , XML , SQL (1999). This makes it accessible for various tools. SIARD is a relatively young format. Software There are tools for converting databases to SIARD and for validating the format, but the possibilities are limited. Some conversion tools such as AccessToSiard and CSV2SIARD can be found via COPTR (Community Owned Preservation ToolRegistry . Using these tools requires the SIARD Suite (free of charge). Recommendations \u00b6 Databases can use routines which may be dependent on their own scripting languages or programming languages from the DBMS. When converting to SIARD there is the potential risk of loss of such routines, but this risk is not considered to be very big because such languages are not expected to become obsolete.

SIARD (Software Independent Archiving of Relational Databases) is intended for archiving relational databases in a way that is as independent of the original DBMS as possible. This format takes into account all the significant characteristics of databases. SIARD is an open, freely available format, based on clear text formats: Unicode , XML , SQL (1999). This makes it accessible for various tools. SIARD is a relatively young format. Software There are tools for converting databases to SIARD and for validating the format, but the possibilities are limited. Some conversion tools such as AccessToSiard and CSV2SIARD can be found via COPTR (Community Owned Preservation ToolRegistry . Using these tools requires the SIARD Suite (free of charge).","title":"Description"},{"location":"fileFormats/siard/#recommendations","text":"Databases can use routines which may be dependent on their own scripting languages or programming languages from the DBMS.

This is a language for querying and updating relational databases. Together with the data definition language, used to define and modify schemas, the contents of a database can be stored as a collection of schema and data statements. The language rarely changes, but various modifications and additions may change along with software updates. When extensions are used, the documentation must show which SQL version has been used. Recommendations \u00b6 In SQL it is possible to refer to non-existent or external data without invalidating the file.
