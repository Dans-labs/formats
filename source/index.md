??? explanation "Legenda"
    A *data type* is a way of organizing raw data for specific modelling applications
    such as image, sound, text, structured data, etc. 

    A file format is a way to serialize the data of a specific data type to a file
    such as [=pdf], [=xlsx], [=siard], etc.

    Applications that deal with that data are programmed in such a way that they can
    read one or more file formats for that type.

    When data is written to file in a specific file format, the file name often gets
    an extension that indicates that file format
    such as [.pdf], [.xlsx], etc.

    There are usually several file formats associated with one data type.
