The company behind
dBase will still support older versions of the format. For versions earlier than

# Recommendation

*dBase* formats can be read in
several different database applications, including
[LibreOffice/OpenOffice]({{libreoffice}}),
[MySQL]({{mysql}})

From these applications, it is possible to export the dBase data
into other formats, such as
