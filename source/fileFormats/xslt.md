## Description

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT)
an vocabulary defined in [=xml]
for transforming [=xml] files.
By transforming an [=xml] to [=html] it is possible to
add [=css] styles to the content, which makes the result an instance of
[:textFormatted].

XSLT can be used as a nearly full fledge programming language.
It can reference other XSLT files as modules.

XSLT is a widely supported open standard.

## Recommendation

We accept it, provided the reference files are archived with it, in such a way
that the references are still valid in the archived situation.
