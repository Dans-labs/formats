# About

[DANS](https://www.dans.knaw.nl)
is developing normative guidelines about data and file types for the purpose
of long-term archiving in its self-service repository
[EASY](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl).

This is a repository for maintaining documentary information
about data types and their associated file formats.

All texts are in Markdown and can be consulted in raw form by browsing the
[folders](https://github.com/Dans-labs/formats)
of this repository, or in formatted form by visiting
the [docs](https://Dans-labs.github.io/formats/).

# Disclaimer

All texts you find here are work in progress.
The currently authoritative texts can be found on the
[prefered formats](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/deposit/information-about-depositing-data/before-depositing/file-formats?set_language=en)
web page of DANS.
